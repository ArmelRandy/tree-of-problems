Given a series of navigation instructions, determine the coordinates (x, y) of the end point.

Q: If you follow these instructions, what are the coordinates of the end point if you start at the point (-2, -3), facing the negative y-axis? Take 2 steps right. Take 9 steps left. Turn right. Take 3 steps right. Take 4 steps. Turn around.
A: Let's think step by step.
We start at the point (-2, -3), facing the negative y-axis.
(1) Take 2 steps right: (-4, -3), facing the negative y-axis.
(2) Take 9 steps left: (5, -3), facing the negative y-axis.
(3) Turn right: (5, -3), facing the negative x-axis.
(4) Take 3 steps right: (5, 0), facing the negative x-axis.
(5) Take 4 steps: (1, 0), facing the negative x-axis.
(6) Turn around: (1, 0), facing the positive x-axis.
So the answer is (1, 0).

Q: If you follow these instructions, what are the coordinates of the end point if you start at the point (0, 0), facing the positive x-axis? Always face forward. Take 2 steps right. Take 9 steps left. Turn right. Take 7 steps right. Take 3 steps backward.
A: Let's think step by step.
We start at the point (0, 0), facing the positive x-axis.
(1) Always face forward: (0, 0), facing the positive x-axis.
(2) Take 2 steps right: (0, -2), facing the positive x-axis.
(3) Take 9 steps left: (0, 7), facing the positive x-axis.
(4) Turn right: (0, 7), facing the negative y-axis.
(5) Take 7 steps right: (-7, 7), facing the negative y-axis.
(6) Take 3 steps backward: (-7, 10), facing the negative y-axis.
So the answer is (-7, 10).

Q: If you follow these instructions, what are the coordinates of the end point if you start at the point (-9, 11), facing the negative x-axis? Turn around. Take 1 step. Take 6 steps. Turn right. Take 6 steps. Take 9 steps. Take 1 step.
A: Let's think step by step.
We start at the (-9, 11), facing the negative x-axis.
(1) Turn around: (-9, 11), facing the positive x-axis.
(2) Take 1 step: (-8, 11), facing the positive x-axis.
(3) Take 6 steps: (-2, 11), facing the positive x-axis.
(4) Turn right: (-2, 11), facing the negative y-axis.
(5) Take 6 steps: (-2, 5), facing the negative y-axis.
(6) Take 9 steps: (-2, -4), facing the negative y-axis.
(7) Take 1 step: (-2, -5), facing the negative y-axis.
So the answer is (-2, -5).

Q: If you follow these instructions, what are the coordinates of the end point if you start at the point (1, 4), facing the positive y-axis? Turn left. Turn around. Turn left. Take 7 steps. Take 2 steps. Take 4 steps backward. Take 8 steps.
A: Let's think step by step.
We start at the point (1, 4), facing the positive y-axis.
(1) Turn left: (1, 4), facing the negative x-axis.
(2) Turn around: (1, 4), facing the positive x-axis.
(3) Turn left: (1, 4), facing the positive y-axis.
(4) Take 7 steps: (1, 11), facing the positive y-axis.
(5) Take 2 steps: (1, 13), facing the positive y-axis.
(6) Take 4 steps backward: (1, 9), facing the positive y-axis.
(7) Take 8 steps: (1, 17), facing the positive y-axis.
So the answer is (1, 17).
