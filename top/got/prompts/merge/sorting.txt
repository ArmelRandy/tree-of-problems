<Instruction> 
Merge the following 2 sorted lists of length {length} each, into one sorted list of length {length_combined}.
</Instruction>

<Examples>
Merge the following two lists into one sorted list:
1. [0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 9]
2. [1, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8]

Let's think step by step.
We first identify the numbers in the first list and include their quantity in parentheses:
- 0 (3)
- 1 (1)
- 3 (1)
- 5 (1)
- 6 (1)
- 9 (1)
We identify the numbers in the second list and include their quantity in parentheses:
- 1 (2)
- 3 (1)
- 5 (1)
- 6 (1)
- 7 (2)
- 8 (1)
For each number between 0 and 9 (inclusive) in both lists, we compute its frequency by adding the number of times it appears in each list:
- 0 (3 + 0 = 3)
- 1 (1 + 2 = 3)
- 3 (1 + 1 = 2)
- 5 (1 + 1 = 2)
- 6 (1 + 1 = 2)
- 7 (0 + 2 = 2)
- 8 (0 + 1 = 1)
- 9 (1 + 0 = 1)
We construct the final list step by step.
First,
- We start with an empty list: []
- We add 0 repeated 3 times: [0, 0, 0]
- We add 1 repeated 3 times: [1, 1, 1]
- We add 3 repeated 2 times: [3, 3]
- We add 5 repeated 2 times: [5, 5]
- We add 6 repeated 2 times: [6, 6]
- We add 7 repeated 2 times: [7, 7]
- We add 8 repeated 1 time: [8]
- We add 9 repeated 1 time: [9]
We concatenate the lists above and obtain the final answer
Merged list: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9]
