<Instruction> Combine the following 2 dictionaries, each containing the frequency of countries in a text, into a single dictionary.
Simply add the frequencies together for each country and if a country is not present in one of the dictionaries, add it to the final dictionary with the frequency from the other dictionary.
</Instruction>

<Examples>
Combine the following 2 dictionaries into a single dictionary:
{{
    "Cameroon": 3,
    "France": 1,
    "Japan": 6,
    "Spain": 2
}}
{{"Spain": 1, "Qatar": 3, "Japan": 2, "Morocco": 7, "Germany": 2}}

Let's think step by step.
We first identify the keys in the first dictionary and include their corresponding values in parentheses:
- "Cameroon" (3)
- "France" (1)
- "Japan" (6)
- "Spain" (2)
We identify the keys in the second dictionary and include their corresponding values in parentheses:
- "Spain" (1)
- "Qatar" (3)
- "Japan" (2)
- "Morocco" (7)
- "Germany" (2)
For each key listed above, we compute its total value by adding the corresponding value in each dictionary:
- "Cameroon" (3 + 0 = 3)
- "France" (1 + 0 = 1)
- "Japan" (6 + 2 = 8)
- "Spain" (2 + 1 = 3)
- "Qatar" (0 + 3 = 3)
- "Morocco" (0 + 7 = 7)
- "Germany" (0 + 2 = 2)

We then build the final dictionary
Combined Output: {{
    "Cameroon": 3,
    "France": 1,
    "Japan": 8,
    "Spain": 3,
    "Qatar": 3,
    "Morocco": 7,
    "Germany": 2
}}
