<Instruction> Count the frequency of how many times each country is explicitly named in the input text. You can generate any intermedate lists and states, but the final output should only contain the frequency of each country that appears at least once in the following json format, prefixed with "Output: " (make sure to keep the same spelling for each country in the output as in the input text):
{{
    "country1": frequency1,
    "country2": frequency2,
    ...
}}
</Instruction>

<Approach>
To count the frequency for each country follow these steps:
1. Split the input passage into four paragraphs of similar length.
2. Count the frequency of each country in each paragraph.
3. Combine the frequencies of each country from each paragraph by adding them together.
</Approach>
